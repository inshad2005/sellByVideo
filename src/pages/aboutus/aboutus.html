            <p>When a buyer or seller issue arises we may consider the user’s performance history and the

                enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.
            </p>
            <h5>Listing Conditions</h5>
            <p>When posting a video listing an item to the SellBuyVideo Web site, you agree that:</p>
            <dl padding>
                <li>You are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing and item offered;</li>
                <li>Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or
                    up to 24 hours in some circumstances). SellBuyVideo can’t guarantee exact listing durations;
                </li>
                <li>Content that violates any of SellBuyVideo’s policies may be deleted at SellBuyVideo’s
                    discretion;
                </li>
                <li>We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. Therefore, the
                    appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of
                    factors, including, but not limited to:
                </li>
                <dd>- Buyer’s location, search query, browsing site, and history;</dd>

            </dl>
            <h5>Purchase Conditions</h5>
            <p>When buying an item, you agree that:</p>
            <ul padding>
                <li>You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or commitment to
                    buy.
                </li>
                <li>You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an
                    item.
                </li>
                <li>For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a nonbinding transaction
                    representing a buyer’s serious expression of interest in buying the seller’s item and does not
                    create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.

                <li>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.</li>

                </li>
                <li>If you purchase that item on a SellBuyVideo site other than SellBuyVideo.com or the
                    SellBuyVideo app, you are subject to the Terms of Service or User Agreement of that other
                    SellBuyVideo site with respect to that particular purchase.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>International Buying and Selling; Translation</h5>
            <p>Many of our Services are accessible to international sellers and buyers. We may offer certain
                programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers,
                such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Sellers
                and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the
                international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.
            </p>
            <p>If you are a seller you authorize us to use automated tools to translate your SellBuyVideo
                content, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. If
                you are a buyer, you may have access to tools which will enable you to translate content at your
                request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed and you should

                corporation organized in the State of Oklahoma, U.S.A. The laws of the State of Oklahoma,
                U.S.A. will govern these Terms of Service, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of
                laws. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
                of the courts of the State of Oklahoma, U.S.A., and of the United States District Court for the
                District of Oklahoma for any litigation arising out of or relating to use of or purchase made
                through SellBuyVideo (and agree not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such
                courts), waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the courts of the
                State of Oklahoma, U.S.A., and agree not to plead or claim in any court of the State of
                Oklahoma, U.S.A. that such litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient
                forum.

            <h5>XIII. Agreement to Arbitrate</h5>
            <p><b>You and SellBuyVideo each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or
                may arise between you and SellBuyVideo relating in any way to or arising out of this or
                previous versions of these Terms of Service, your use of or access to SellBuyVideo’s
                Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through SellBuyVideo’s
                Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in
                court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims
                qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual
                (nonclass, nonrepresentative) basis.</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
            </p>
            <p><b>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Nonindividualized Relief</b></p>
            <p><b>YOU AND SELLBUYVIDEO AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS
                AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A
                PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND
                SELLBUYVIDEO AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
                CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS,
                AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED,
                REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY
                AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
                RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND
                ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY
                THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOTAFFECT OTHER USERS.</b>
            </p>
            <h5>AFFECT OTHER USERS.</h5>
            <h5>Arbitration Procedures</h5>
            <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead
                of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an
                arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to
                an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of these Terms of Service as a court would.
                All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or
                enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement
                to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”),
                shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
            </p>
            <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its
                rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as
                modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by
                calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 FREE. The use of the word “arbitrator” in this provision
                shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration:
                rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration
                conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.
            </p>
            <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written
                notice describing the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail (“Notice”). The Notice to
                SellBuyVideo should be sent to SellBuyVideo, LLC, at PO Box 691901, Tulsa, OK 74169.
                SellBuyVideo will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated
                with your SellBuyVideo account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to
                date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the
                nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.
            </p>
            <p>If you and SellBuyVideo are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days
                after the Notice is sent, you or SellBuyVideo may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for
                initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at www.adr.org. In addition to
                filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the
                arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy
                to SellBuyVideo at the following address: SellBuyVideo, Inc, PO Box 691901, Tulsa, OK
                74169. In the event SellBuyVideo initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the
                completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your SellBuyVideo
                account. Any settlement offer made by you or SellBuyVideo shall not be disclosed to the
                arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually
                agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or SellBuyVideo mayelect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions,
                which election shall be binding on you and SellBuyVideo subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to
                require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is
                held, you and/or SellBuyVideo may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law,
                including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by
                law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users,
                but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same SellBuyVideo user to the extent
                required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the
                award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
            </p>
            <h5>Costs of Arbitration</h5>
            <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules,
                unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000
                or less, at your request, SellBuyVideo will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
                associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by SellBuyVideo should be
                submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and SellBuyVideo will
                make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator
                determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse
                SellBuyVideo for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by SellBuyVideo on your behalf
                that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.
            </p>
            <h5>Severability</h5>
            <p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate
                (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), if an
                arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or
                unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or
                court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition
                of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”) is invalid or unenforceable,
                then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the
                Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.
            </p>
            <h5>Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate</h5>
            <p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and we agree that
                if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any
                notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any
                claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against SellBuyVideo prior to the effective date of the
                amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the
                Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and SellBuyVideo. We will
                notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms onSellBuyVideo.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing
                notice through the SellBuyVideo Message Center and/or by email. If you do not agree to these
                amended terms, you may close your account within the 30 day period and you will not be bound
                by the amended terms.
            </p>
            <h5>XIV. MODIFICATION OF TERMS</h5>

            <h5>XVI. GENERAL</h5>
            <p>The provisions of these Terms of Service are intended to be severable. If for any reason any
                provision of these Terms of Service shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in
                any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
                invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability
                thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.

            <p>No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and
                SellBuyVideo as a result of these Terms of Service. The failure of SellBuyVideo to enforce any

                provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by SellBuyVideo in writing.
            </p>

        The idea for this app came in 2012 when we decided there must be a more realistic way to promote marketplace classifieds. The inactive, lifeless picture told only half the story of the item. Video is the new norm and only way to capture the authenticity without actually being there, thus SaleBuyVideo was created.

        <p class="color-st font-st" text-wrap>
        Wonder no more if something works, functions properly, or is factual because video will help tell the story! SaleBuyVideo was created for those who want to create a more animated Sale, Buy with confidence, and utilize the closest medium to being in person, Video!
